FMM-MC Documentation
====================

This is the documentation for the reference implementation of the FMM-MC algorithm described in *A new algorithm for electrostatic interactions in Monte Carlo simulations of charged particles*, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16622.pdf, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2020.110099.

We provide this implementation as an extension to the performance-portable Molecular Dynamics framework (PPMD): https://github.com/ppmd/ppmd. 

The source code is available at https://github.com/ppmd/coulomb_mc.
