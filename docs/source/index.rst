FMM-MC Documentation
====================

This is the documentation for the reference implementation of the FMM-MC algorithm described in *Monte Carlo simulations of interacting particles with fast and accurate electrostatics*, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16622.pdf.

We provide this implementation as an extension to the performance-portable Molecular Dynamics framework (PPMD): https://github.com/ppmd/ppmd. 

The source code will be made available at https://github.com/ppmd/coulomb_mc.
